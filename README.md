# Documentation
## Installing, Building, and Running the Project
    
 - Run `yarn install` to install the required packages
 - Run `yarn start` to compile and run the application with hot-reloading enabled



## Assumptions
- This application is primarily used on a mobile device, therefore a mobile-first design/layout should be implemented.
- This application will not used outside of Minneapolis, MN, meaning localization strings
are not important.


## Potential Future Enhancements



## Random Notes
- Initially thought of using Material UI 5 with a custom hook to replace makeStyles (useClasses or something like that) but that didn't pan out too well.
