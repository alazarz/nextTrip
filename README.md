## Installing, Building, and Running the Project
    
 - Run `yarn install` to install the required packages
 - Run `yarn start` to compile and run the application with hot-reloading enabled


## Assumptions

just want to know the stops that a bus or train will make and where these stops are located.
- IE is not supported.
- This application is meant to be used on a mobile device.
