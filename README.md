# Documentation
## Installing, Building, and Running the Project
    
 - Run `yarn install` to install the required packages
 - Run `yarn start` to compile and run the application with hot-reloading enabled



## Assumptions
- This application is primarily used on a mobile device, therefore a mobile-first design/layout should be implemented.
- This application will be not used outside of Minneapolis, MN, implying that localization strings 
are not important.


## Potential Future Enhancements



## Random notes taken during the development of this project.
- Initially thought of using Material UI 5 with a custom hook that uses emotion library's css() to replace makeStyles (denoted useClasses or something like that).
- There was a small learning curve with using the latest version of React Router.
