## Installing, Building, and Running the Project
    
 - Run `yarn install` to install the required packages
 - Run `yarn start` to compile and run the application with hot-reloading enabled


## Assumptions
- This application will be not used outside of Minneapolis, MN, implying that localization strings are not important.
- The users of this application are **not** looking for departure times or data. They
just want to know the stops that a bus or train will make and where these stops are located.
